              Event description: To help further this moment of collective
              action for justice, we ask that you gather with us for a community
              talk and vigil addressing racism and police violence in the United
              States. On the west lawn of Beyond Baroqueâ€™s community garden,
              scholars, poets, and artists, including Dr. Bob Myers (UCLA), and
              Doctoral Candidate @thabisilegriffin (UCLA) will speak on the
              histories that led to this current movement, and tackle the
              pressing tasks of abolishing police and building a just new world.
              @zilcraft and @penttigram will present unique protest art
              illustrating those ideas. Water and sunscreen will be provided on
              site for all who attend. To ensure safety, we ask that you wear
              masks, and social distancing is encouraged.
