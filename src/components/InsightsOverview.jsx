                  If we break down and categorize the data into key attributes,
                  we have an opportunity to build complex reports for any
                  situation. Data attributes can be organized from the top-down,
                  meaning we can find similarities at the high level and
                  differentiate on drill down.

                  and it would be slowly transitioned into the coded prototype
                  where we would test further.

                  means nothing. As consultants we couldn’t influence the
                  direction of the back-end team to a great degree but I wish we
                  had conversations sooner on the importance integrating a wider
                  range of data then they currently have as it caused some
                  bottle-necks later down the line. Good news is that the first
                  slice of Insights Center modern experience is currently in
                  development, starting with restructuring the back-end.
