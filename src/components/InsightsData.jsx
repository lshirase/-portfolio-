          Redesigning Insights Center posed a significant challenge in
          integrating a multitude of data, reports, and workflows, scattered
          across various platforms, into a cohesive and centralized interface.
          In order for us to design something that empowers users to filter
          through vast datasets and conduct in-depth explorations in the
          reports, we had to deeply understand the data we were working with.

                  in our interface, there was no indication on how filters
                  interacted with each other. While our hierarchy was clear from
                  a zoomed out view (report -&gt; report filters -&gt; widgets
                  -&gt; widget filters), the report filter design did not

                  Our new filtering system was more opinionated, with “rules”

                  left to right. <br />
                  <br />
                  It is clear how the transaction hierarchy influenced the
                  designs, as seen with the Activity Type as the first option,
                  which will change all of the options below it.

                  We chose to remove dropdowns and showcase each filter element
                  so as they are toggled on and off, users can see if it altered
                  any options to the adjacent filters. For an example, if Debit
                  is selected, it will remove some networks and BINs that are to
                  the right of it as Mastercard does not offer debit and the
                  BINs associated with Mastercard will be removed.
