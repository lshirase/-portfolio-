                        We had about two weeks to fully flesh out a solution to
                        pitch to Verizon so time was of the essence. The team
                        consisted of myself as lead user experience designer,
                        Armond as lead product designer, Debbie as motion
                        graphics artist, and Ariana as user experience intern.
                        The general starting point presented to us was somehow
                        utilizing the capability of multiple video feeds into a
                        robust user experience.

                        We didn&apos;t just want to throw up a bunch of random
                        videos at once and call it a day, so we took a step back
                        to see what would actually be interesting to someone who
                        has at the Super Bowl. We didn&apos;t have the time or
                        resources to for a fresh research phase so we had to
                        improvise. Luckily I had been at the NFL for quite some
                        time when we received this project so I had a fairly
                        comprehensive understanding of our previous research.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We had a tremendous amount of past research both that I
                        had personally conducted or have looked through when I
                        was first on boarded. Through usability tests, field
                        research, focus groups, among other things, we had a
                        fairly accurate pulse on the football fan. What we then
                        had to do was frame this knowledge and understanding to
                        our problem space.

                        One output of this was a journey map for a previous
                        Super Bowl game. We chose the one that the Eagles were
                        in for some reason (Ariana was and still is, an Eagles
                        die-hard). The journey map allowed us to identify gaps
                        within the live in-stadium experience that hopefully
                        uncover opportunities for us to provide something
                        meaningful.
                        <br />
                        <br />A major gap we identified was when a special play
                        called &ldquo;The Philly Special&rdquo; occurred. It had
                        happened so fast and it was a play with movements so
                        unusual that it was difficult to understand what
                        happened even on the TV with announcers let alone in the
                        stadium.

                      This was the gap we were looking for, a moment where we
                      could imagine someone actually using their phone to look
                      at something that&apos;s not social media while at the
                      stadium, not some wild and convoluted scenario to force
                      our idea.

                        and erased more ideas, screen configurations, and
                        features than I can count. We sat in a room with a

                        <div>

                        From these needs, we knew more or less what kind of
                        experience we wanted to provide. We wanted angles of the
                        same play to negate the bad viewing angle of sitting in
                        a stadium. We wanted stats and overlays to provide the
                        analysis and emphasis that a television viewer would
                        get. We wanted a to easily scan for big moments to take
                        advantage of the lulls in the game in addition to being
                        able to quickly identify and watch a big play that just
                        happened. <br />
                        <br />
                        More and more we began to see what this thing we were
                        working for was going to be. However it seemed that the
                        more clear things got, the less time we had. We had to
                        be more strategic with our time for the second half of
                        this project. We not only had to flesh out our idea but
                        also a pitch to Verizon.

                        being this storyboard I created to provide us context

                        interface we were also sourcing multiple videos of the
                        Philly Special play, time stamping and describing where
                        we wanted the frames to go to Debbie.

                        We were doing concurrently while handling other projects
                        within the NFL, so it was hectic to say the least.

                      While this was one of the most hectic projects I have ever
                      been on, it was also one of the most exciting. I think
                      this will go down my favorite thing I have done at the

                      Our pitch was extremely well received and the room was on
                      board right away. The artifacts we created throughout the
                      process were not only helpful to us while ideating and
                      designing but also invaluable during our presentation in
                      order to tell the story of our experience. The room really
                      enjoyed seeing the journey map and storyboard and the
                      prototype was the push we needed to really
                      &ldquo;wow&rdquo; them. <br />
                      <br />
                      We were prepared to defend our designs but we didn&apos;t
                      have to. Instead the room was talking amongst themselves
                      about what next steps needed to be taken in order for this
                      project to be ready by Super Bowl. Having worked so hard
                      and after putting in so many hours into the project, it
                      was a great feeling to see our work striking a chord.

                    and empowering moments of my UX career so far.
